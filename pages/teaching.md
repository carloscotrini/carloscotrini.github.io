#### <u>An elementary introduction to quantum computing (VMI retreat 2019)</u>
*We present here all the basics for quantum computation, using only linear algebra over the real numbers. No previous knowledge of quantum mechanics or analysis with complex numbers is required.*

#### <u>A dog, a vegan flea, and the EM algorithm (Statistical Learning Theory 2019)</u>
*A simple, but rigorous derivation of the expectation-maximization algorithm using a bidimensional dog and a vegan flea.*
